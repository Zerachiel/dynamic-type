Dynamic Type in iOS 7
============

An iOS app demonstrating Dynamic Type on iOS 7.  It includes two example controllers:

* A `UITableViewController` that can switch between the system font and a custom font.
* A `UIScrollView` that uses Auto Layout to position a title, image, and body text.

Custom fonts are implemented through a `UIFont` category that can easily be adapted to other projects.
